        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h1>5ive Group : A Home of Premium Jewellery Collection</h1>
        <p>5ive Group was founded in 2019 by a team of enterprising entrepreneurs, led by the visionary genius of Mr. Sujal Patel when he explored beyond his immediate circle in the agri-corp industry to establish a jewellery trading 
          company in a historical city called Surat. 
          Since then, keeping alive the golden spirit of the brand, 
          the Group has remained constant, in its successful forays nurtured by expertise,
           vision and guidance, into a formidable business conglomerate.
